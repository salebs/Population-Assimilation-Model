# Population-Assimilation-Model
This project shows two populations assimilate into one or push out the other. 

Run the main file to input user parameters and see the populations assimilate. 
The populations are described by their value: one initial population is a small positive number, the other initial population is a small negative number, and the assimilated population is a large positive number.
